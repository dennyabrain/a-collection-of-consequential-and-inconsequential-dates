        post:'I go to an art exhibition on digital surveillance and see some 3D-like postcards. They look like something that a strange being like you may cherish. There is a chance that you would just go \'meh\' and toss them into a pile of nothings. There is also the possibility that you would totally go berserk about how cool they are and send it to loved ones. Since that is a rare occasion I am willing to tell the convinience-seeking side of my brain to lay low this time. I start thinking about the right occasion to post these to you'

        post:'You post timelapse images of locations on your blog that makes a light go off in my head. Even though you are a nerd of many things, since I do not share a lot of those passions with you, it is hard to place a finger on what physical object you might like. I think, is it possible that a LOTR reading, Ursula Le Guin loving, google timelapse publishing being might be into Maps? ðŸ˜²'

        post:'I am mildly dissapointed that these postcards are free. Because they feel like they should cost money. They look like something of value must be exchanged in order to acquire them. I prepare myself to to spend around 20 dollars for two postcard. I feel that if you like them, it would be nice for you to keep one for yourself and send the other one to a loved one. Since they were free I picked up all unique copies and also some not so good postcards. I am sure you would want to send postcards to your not-that-much-loved-ones too ðŸ˜œ'

When it does, I literally grab my neck to stop me from saying that \'Actually I was planning a surprise for you\'. I believe that it remains the best display of my growth and character in the past 5 years ðŸ˜œ'
